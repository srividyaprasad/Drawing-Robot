# Mecanum-Wheeled Drawing Mobile Robot

## Overview
Developed a unique 4-wheeled omnidirectional robot using Mecanum wheels and precision encoder motors, all brought together with ROS for various drawing, writing and painting applications. This includes Factory Lane Marking, large sized Architectural Drawings and recreational Rangoli, fractal or any other forms of art.

## Hardware
- Mecanum wheels
- Custom chassis
- High-precision encoder servo motors
- Cytron motor drivers
- Teensy microcontroller

## Software/Tech Stack
- ROS
- Gazebo
- OpenCV
- Arduino IDE

## Details
Implementation of kinematics, PID control, odometry, and planner extracted from image processing of reference.
Novel application of art creation. 
Framework for a new combination of hardware.
Advanced insights into ROS with OpenCV while designing computer vision algorithms for generating strokes by extracting splines from images and then finding waypoints for mobile robot navigation.
